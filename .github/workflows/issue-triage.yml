               - Impact on users
               - Security implications
               - Difficulty to implement
            3. **Labels**: Suggest appropriate labels from: bug, enhancement, question, documentation, good first issue, help wanted
            4. **Assignment**: Suggest if this should be assigned to frontend, backend, or documentation team
            5. **Effort Estimation**: Provide rough estimate (1-5 story points)
