# ❓ Question: How to deploy TaskFlow Manager to production?

## 🤔 Question

I've been testing TaskFlow Manager locally and it works great! What's the recommended approach for deploying this application to a production environment?

## 🎯 Context

- I'm planning to use this for my team of 15 developers
- We have experience with AWS and Docker
- Security and performance are important considerations
- We'd like to integrate with our existing authentication system

## 📋 Specific Questions

### 1. **Deployment Architecture**

- What's the recommended hosting setup?
- Should the frontend and backend be deployed separately?
- Are there any specific infrastructure requirements?

### 2. **Database Configuration**

- The demo uses in-memory storage - what database should we use for production?
- Are there any schema migration scripts available?
- What about data backup and recovery strategies?

### 3. **Security Considerations**

- How should we handle the Gemini API key in production?
- Are there any security headers or configurations we should implement?
- What authentication/authorization options are supported?

### 4. **Performance Optimization**

- Are there any specific performance tuning recommendations?
- How does the application scale with thousands of tasks?
- Should we implement caching strategies?

### 5. **Monitoring and Observability**

- How can we monitor the Gemini CLI integrations?
- Are there health check endpoints we should monitor?
- What logging should we implement?

## 🛠️ Our Current Setup

- **Cloud Provider:** AWS
- **Container Orchestration:** EKS (Kubernetes)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana
- **Auth:** Okta SAML SSO
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on RDS

## 📚 Documentation Reviewed

## 🎯 Ideal Answer

I'm looking for:

- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Docker/Kubernetes configuration examples
- Environment variables and configuration options
- Best practices for production usage
- Common gotchas to avoid

## 🚀 Urgency

We're planning to deploy this in the next 2 weeks, so any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
