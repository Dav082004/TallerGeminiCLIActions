# ✨ Feature Request: Task filtering by date range

## 🎯 Summary

Add the ability to filter tasks by custom date ranges to help users focus on tasks within specific time periods.

## 💡 Motivation

As a power user of TaskFlow Manager, I often need to view tasks that are due within specific timeframes (e.g., "this week", "next month", "overdue tasks"). The current filters only allow filtering by status and priority, which isn't sufficient for time-based task management.

## 📋 Detailed Description

I would like to see a date range picker component added to the existing filter section that allows users to:

1. **Select custom date ranges** using an intuitive date picker interface
2. **Use preset ranges** like "Today", "This Week", "This Month", "Next 7 days"
3. **Filter by due date** to see only tasks due within the selected range
4. **Combine with existing filters** (status, priority, search) for powerful filtering
5. **Persist filter state** so selections remain when navigating or refreshing

## 🎨 Proposed Solution

Add a new filter group to the existing filter card with the following components:

### Date Range Picker

- **From Date:** Input field with calendar picker
- **To Date:** Input field with calendar picker
- **Preset Buttons:** Quick selection for common ranges

### Preset Options

- Today
- Tomorrow
- This Week
- Next 7 Days
- This Month
- Next Month
- Overdue (past due dates)
- No Due Date

### Integration

- Should work alongside existing status and priority filters
- Filter combinations should be AND operations
- Clear filters button should reset date range as well

## 📱 User Interface Mockup

```
Filter Section:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Status: [All ▼] Priority: [All ▼] Search: [____]   │
│                                                     │
│ Date Range: [Today ▼] From: [📅] To: [📅] [Clear] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Date range picker is added to filter section
- [ ] Preset buttons work correctly
- [ ] Custom date ranges can be selected
- [ ] Filters combine properly with existing filters
- [ ] Filter state persists across page reloads
- [ ] Performance remains good with large task lists
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

- Consider using a lightweight date picker library
- Ensure date operations handle timezones correctly
- Optimize filtering performance for large datasets
- Add proper validation for date inputs
- Consider internationalization for date formats

## 🎯 User Stories

- **As a project manager**, I want to see all tasks due this week so I can plan my team's workload
- **As a freelancer**, I want to filter overdue tasks so I can prioritize catching up
- **As a student**, I want to see assignments due in the next 7 days so I can plan my study schedule

## 📊 Business Value

- **Increased user engagement** through better task organization
- **Improved productivity** by allowing focused time-based planning
- **Enhanced user experience** with more flexible filtering options
- **Competitive advantage** over simpler task management tools

## 🚧 Implementation Notes

This feature could be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Basic date range filtering
2. **Phase 2:** Preset buttons and quick selections
3. **Phase 3:** Advanced features like recurring date filters
